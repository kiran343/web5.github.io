<p>KG Hospital Regional Blood Bank is one of the few designated Regional Transfusion Centres in Tamil Nadu. The Blood Bank is having state-of-the-art equipment and employing the latest technology to render blood safer for transfusion.

This is the second Blood Bank in India to incorporate gel technology from Switzerland for blood grouping and cross-matching. This advanced technology provides accurate results among other features, thus bringing the Blood Bank on par with those in the Western countries.

Our Blood Bank has got an Aphaeresis Machine which makes single donor plasma exchange possible.

Every unit of blood collected in the Blood Bank is tested for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, Syphilis, Malaria and SGPT.

A high SGPT value can denote the presence of Hepatitis C virus even if the result is negative when testing for antibodies to the virus. In addition, blood is tested for Cytomegalovirus before transfusion for transplant patients.</p>
